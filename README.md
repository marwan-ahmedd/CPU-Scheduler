# CPU-Scheduler
This project implements a CPU scheduler simulator that demonstrates three popular scheduling algorithms: Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Priority Scheduling. 
It incorporates solid principles to ensure code quality, maintainability, and testability.
# Features:
Simulates CPU scheduling: Execute processes with various arrival times and burst times according to the chosen algorithm.
Multiple algorithms: Implementations of SJF, SRTF, and Priority scheduling with configurable priority levels.
Solid principles: Adhere to principles like Single Responsibility, Open/Closed Principle, Dependency Inversion, and Liskov Substitution Principle for clean and maintainable code.
Test-driven development: Utilize unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of each algorithm implementation.
Detailed logging and output: Track process execution, context switches, and relevant metrics for analysis.
